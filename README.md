## 🔍 Insights
Uncover:
- High-performing product categories and states
  Office Supplies is the top-selling product category ($2.08M), slightly ahead of Electronics ($2.06M) and
  Furniture ($2.04M). In terms of geography, New York leads with $1.13M in sales, followed by Florida and
  California (both around $1.09M), Texas ($1.01M), Illinois ($0.98M), and Ohio ($0.88M). This shows strong
  product performance across multiple categories and high revenue concentration in key U.S. states.
- Payment preference analytics
  Debit cards are the most preferred payment method (21.78%), followed closely by credit cards (21.61%)
  and UPI (21.11%). EMI (18.26%) and Cash on Delivery (17.25%) trail behind. This suggests a strong shift
  toward digital and card-based payments, with COD becoming less dominant.
